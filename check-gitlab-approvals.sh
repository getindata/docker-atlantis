# Script checks if GitLab MR was approved by allowed user. It's intention is to work around
# free GitLab limitations (no CODEOWNERS, required approvals).
#
# This script makes great use of yq, jq, glab commands and they should be installed
# and availiable in $PATH priror script execution
#
# Approvers configuration can be set in number of ways:
# - By pointing `APPROVAL_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable to proper APPROVAL_CONFIG yaml file
# - By passing path to APPROVAL_CONFIG yaml file as the first input argument to this script
# - By directly populating `APPROVAL_CONFIG` environment variable with configuration
#
# APPROVAL_CONFIG is a `yaml` file with list of approved GitLab usernames per project, example:
# ---
# repository:
#   REPOSITORY:
#     allowed_approvers:
#       - GITLAB_USERNAME
#   getindata/devops/dummy-test-project:
#     allowed_approvers:
#       - john.doe
#   getindata/devops/aws/gid-aws-terragrunt-platform:
#     allowed_approvers:
#       - jane.doe
#       - example_username
#
# We assume that env variables are populated correctly (according to Atlantis dockumentation)
# and script is executed in proper custom workflow context:
# - ATLANTIS_GITLAB_TOKEN
# - HEAD_REPO_OWNER
# - HEAD_REPO_NAME
# - PULL_NUM

# Get approval-config.yaml file path from: environment variable or 1st argument, 
# use default when nothing is set
if [ $# -gt 0 ]; then
  # if ARG is passed to script, use it
  APPROVAL_CONFIG_PATH=${1}
elif [ ! -v APPROVAL_CONFIG_PATH ] || [ -z APPROVAL_CONFIG_PATH ]; then
  # if env is not set or is empty set default
